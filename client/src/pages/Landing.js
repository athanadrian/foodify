            At the end of November my wife with her business partners and I
            visited restaurant "<span className='important'>foody...</span>" to
            have our "<span className='important'>dinner...</span>". It was
            located on the "<span className='important'>village...</span>". It
            is built in the style of a huntsman's hut. This restaurant was
            chosen for its unique "<span className='important'>cuisine...</span>

            could have a conversation.

            surprised our guests â€“ it looked like a newspaper and no one guessed
            to look into it. Several newspapers were lying at our tables not
            catching our attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            The uniqueness of the restaurant lies in that you end up having an
            excellent dinner without have to spend a large amount of money cause
            the "<span className='important'>cost...</span>" was..........
